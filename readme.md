## About The Project

OpenSpaceData.org democratizes satellite data. The aim of the project is to provide a search tool that makes it easier for everyone to find data, regardless of technical or professional knowledge. To this end, freely available satellite data, such as those of ESA or NASA, will be centralized on OpenSpaceData to facilitate access to them via a simple search mask. The tool translates the user's need into the appropriate parameters of the satellite program. Whether individuals (journalists, scientists, interested citizens) or groups (initiatives, associations): Access to and use of the data increases democratic participation in society.

The 12 Copernicus satellites of ESA alone deliver 250 TB of data per day. The problem: Often technical (APIs) and professional knowledge (determination of sensors, specific parameters, etc.) is needed to retrieve data. OpenSpaceData is intended to provide easy access to this socially relevant information. This ensures that everyone - citizen or NGO - can classify events independently. An example: Thanks to OpenSpaceData, it is possible to access near-real-time data on pollutant emissions. This enables NGOs or journalists to quickly identify impending environmental disasters. The same applies to humanitarian organizations that want to act after disasters such as the explosion in Beirut.

## Getting Started

It is essential to understand what information satellite data hold for us and how they can help us. Therefore I have compiled a few cases that show the benefits of this technology:
- [Impact assesments after natural disasters](https://www.planet.com/insights/anatomy-of-a-catastrophe/)
- [Doctors Without Borders Utilise Satellite Data for Humanitarian Missions ](https://en.reset.org/blog/helping-hand-outer-space-doctors-without-borders-utilise-satellite-data-humanitarian-missions-1)
- [Journalism: Fact-checking with open-source satellite images](https://medium.com/@techjournalism/fact-checking-with-open-source-satellite-images-part-1-8a76962c76e5)
- [How earth observation data and analytics is helping tackle climate change](https://www.geoawesomeness.com/earth-observation-data-analytics-climate-change/)

Here you will find some resources to get started with earth observation:
- [Satellites 101: Overview](https://medium.com/upstream/satellites-101-overview-from-upstream-tech-934019adf796)
- [How to use satellite data for better decision making](https://www.iceye.com/satellite-data)
- [Remote Sensing Indices](https://medium.com/regen-network/remote-sensing-indices-389153e3d947)

## Contributing

If you have any ideas, just [open an issue](https://github.com/NiklasJordan/OpenSpaceData/issues) and tell me what you think.

Currently, I primarily need help with the validation of the concept. Would you like to use satellite images yourself and have time to talk to me about your ideas? Then please contact me. As soon as I am in the implementation, you are welcome to code as well! Anyway, if you feel like helping, get in touch with me!
